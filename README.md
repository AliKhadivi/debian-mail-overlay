## hardware/debian-mail-overlay

This overlay base image contains Debian Stretch slim (remove some extra files that are normally not necessary within containers, such as man pages and documentation), compile skarnet.org's small & secure supervision software suite (skalibs, execline, s6) and build Rspamd, the fast, free and open-source spam filtering system.

Please see the [main repository](https://github.com/hardware/mailserver) for instructions.
